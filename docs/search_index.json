["the-package.html", "3 The package 3.1 Function bivar", " 3 The package The R package iRegression contains the following functions: bivar is a function that fits a regression model for interval-valued variables based on the bivariate symbolic regression method (BSRM); crm is a function that fits a linear regression model based on the center and range method (CRM); ccrm is function that fits a linear regression with inequality constraints over the range’s parameters (CCRM); MinMax is a function that fits a linear regression model for interval variables based on the MinMax method; cm is a function that fits a linear regression model based on the center method; All five functions require an object of class formula giving the symbolic description of the regression model to be estimated. Methods for analyzing the models above are also provided. The functions coef(), fitted() and residuals() extract the estimated coefficients, fitted values and residuals from the adjusted models. An object from any of the five classes can be summarized through the function summary(). 3.1 Function bivar The function bivar() can be used to estimate the parameter of a gaussian bivariate regression model for interval variables. It is possible to consider any pair of interval features for the bivariate random vector \\(\\pmb Y\\). For example, the lower and upper interval bounds or the midpoint and the range of intervals, respectively. The function is used as bivar(formula1, lig1, formula2, lig2, data, ...) and considers the following arguments: formula1: an object of class formula that represents the symbolic description of the first marginal model; lig1: represents the link function to be considered for the first model; formula2: an object of class formula that represents the symbolic description of the second marginal model; lig2: represents the link function to be considered for the second model; data: an optional data frame containing the variables of the models. Notice that it is possible to choose from different link functions (identity, inverse or log) to connect the random variables \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) with the respective linear predictors \\(\\eta_1\\) and \\(\\eta_2\\). The function summary.bivar() returns the following elements, given an object of the class bivar: Coefficients1 and Coefficients2: the vectors of coefficients for the explanatory variables of the models 1 and 2, respectively; RMSE1 and RMSE2: the root mean square error for the models 1 and 2, respectively; Rho: the estimate for the correlation coefficient between \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\); Phi: the estimate of the dispersion parameter; D: the goodness-of-fit measure deviance for the current model. The function bivar() considers the expression (??) to estimate the vectors of coefficients \\(\\hat{\\pmb \\beta_1}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\pmb \\beta_2}\\), the expression (??) to compute the Deviance for the current model, and the expressions (??) and (??) provide, respectively, the estimates of the dispersion parameter \\(\\hat{\\phi}\\) and the correlation coefficient \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\). Moreover, the function coef.bivar() returns just the estimated coefficients while the functions fitted.bivar() and residuals.bivar() provide, respectively, the matrices of the fitted values and the residuals for an object of the class bivar. The expression (??) is used to obtain the residual deviance. The function bivar considers the bivariate gaussian distribution as probabilistic support for the error of the model BSRM and the following elements belongs from an object of class bivar: coefficients1: a named vector of coefficients for the explanatory variables of the model “1”; coefficients2: a named vector of coefficients for the explanatory variables of the model “2”; fitted.values1: the fitted values for the response variable \\(\\pmb Y_1\\); fitted.values2: the fitted values for the response variable \\(\\pmb Y_2\\); residuals1: the ordinary residual for the response variable \\(\\pmb Y_1\\); residuals2: the ordinary residual for the response variable \\(\\pmb Y_2\\); residual.deviance: the global residual for the bivariate vector \\(\\pmb Y = [\\pmb Y_1, \\pmb Y_2]\\); Rho: the estimative for the correlation coefficient between \\(\\pmb Y_1\\) and \\(\\pmb Y_2\\); Phi:the estimative of the dispersion parameter; D: the goodness-of-fit measure deviance for the current model.

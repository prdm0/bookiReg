Each observation \\(y_{i} = [y_{Li},y_{Ui}] \\in Y\\) is defined as an interval \\(y \\in \\Im = \\{[y_{L},y_{U}] : y_{L}, y_{U} \\in \\Re, y_{L} \\leq y_{U}\\}\\) and represents the observed value of the interval variable \\(Y\\). Despite the loss of information, we consider an interval-valued variable \\(Y\\) as a two-dimensional or a bivariate quantitative feature vector \\(\\mathbf y_{i}=(y_{1i},y_{2i})\\), where the variables \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) are one-dimensional random variables representing, for example, the lower and upper boundaries \\((Y^{L},Y^{U})\\) or the midpoint and half-range \\((Y^{m},Y^{r})\\) of the intervals or any other pair of interval features possible to be represented. Consider that the joint density probability function of the bivariate quantitative feature vector \\(\\mathbf y_{i}=(y_{1i},y_{2i})\\) belongs to the bivariate exponential family of distributions defined by \\[\\begin{equation} f(\\mathbf y; \\pmb \\theta)= \\mathrm{exp}\\left[\\phi^{-1}\\{y_{1}\\theta_{1} + y_{2}\\theta_{2} - b(\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2},\\rho)\\}+ c(y_{1},y_{2},\\rho,\\phi)\\right], \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\theta\\)= \\((\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2})\\) is the vector of canonical parameters, \\(\\phi\\) is a common dispersion parameter and \\(\\rho\\) is a constant correlation parameter between these two random variables. We assume that the functions \\(b(\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot)\\) and \\(c(\\cdot,\\cdot, \\cdot, \\cdot)\\) are known. The function \\(b(\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot)\\) is the cumulant generating function of () and the mean and variance of the bivariate random vector \\(\\mathbf Y=(Y_1, Y_2)\\) can be obtained from well-known equations of natural exponential families and presents a direct relation with the GLM framework. The log-likelihood function for the \\(i\\)th observation can be written as \\[\\begin{equation} l_{i} = l_{i}(\\pmb \\theta,\\phi,\\rho) = \\phi^{-1} \\{y_{1i}\\theta_{1} + y_{2i}\\theta_{2}-b(\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2},\\rho)\\}+c(y_{1i},y_{2i},\\rho,\\phi). \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] The use of the bivariate exponential family of distributions allows to extend the GLM framework for the case of interval-valued variables.
